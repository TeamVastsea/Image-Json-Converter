# Image-Json Converter

## Introduction
- This is a simple tool written in Python that provides a quick way to convert **Black and White Images** into **Json Files** for the [Fureniku's Roads](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/furenikusroads) Mod.
- Although the Fureniku's Roads Mod officially provides users with a Web Tool [[Click to Jump](http://fureniku.com/roads/editor)], in reality it is not practical, so I developed this program.

## Use
- Drag the target image to the application, and click the 'Convert',  then there will be a Json file named same as the image generated.
